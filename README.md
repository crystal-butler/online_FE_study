# online_FE_study
The code for an online study measuring how well naive judges recognize spontaneaous facial expressions of emotion. 
It does not include the images used in the study, which must be in a directory called "images" at the top level
of the website structure. Participant responses are saved in a cookie and emailed to the researcher
when the study is complete, so no data storage backend is required.
