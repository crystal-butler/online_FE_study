				<h2>Study Detail</h2>
				<p>The majority of studies that have examined the theory of universal emotional expression have used posed test faces. 
				In contrast, our work uses spontaneous expressions. We will be 
				looking at how various factors influence the ways that untrained observers perceive these emotional faces.</p>

				<h2>What You'll Do</h2>
				<h3>The following series of tasks begin on the next page.</h3>
				<h4>Before We Begin</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>1) We will ask for your racial/ethnic self-identification. Your answer will not be connected to any personally identifiable information.</li>
					<li>2) We will ask for your gender, which will also be stored anonymously.
				</ol>
				<h4>Part 1</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>1) You will be shown a series of pictures of faces depicting emotions elicited by real-life situations. There will be 36 images, each of 
					which will be shown for 200 milliseconds. The first 3 images will be for practice, and your responses to them will not be recorded. </li>
					<li>2) A list of 9 emotions is shown to the right of each displayed image. You will select the description that best fits
					the image. Only one box can be chosen, and an answer must be given before you can click through to the next trial.
					You can take as much time as needed to categorize the emotion.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Part 2</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>1) You will be shown the same images as in Part 1, but they will be displayed for 2000 milliseconds. The pictures will appear 
					in a different order, with the exception of the 3 initial practice images.</li>
					<li>2) You will again select the best 1 of 9 emotion options for each image. An answer must be given before you can click 
					through to the next trial. Take as much time as needed to make your category choice.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Completion</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>After completing both parts, you will be taken to a page where you will send your data set. There will also be additional 
					information on facial expression recognition and interpretation.</li>
				</ol>
