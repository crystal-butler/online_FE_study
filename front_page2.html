				<h2>About the Study</h2>
				<p>Interest in facial expressions and their connection to
				universally experienced human emotions dates back to Charles Darwin&#8217;s 1872 book <span style="font-style:italic">The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</span>. Research
				conducted by leading emotion researcher Paul Ekman and others has lead to greater understanding of similarities and differences across cultures. However, most research on observers&#8217; ability to recognize emotions in facial expressions has involved the use of posed facial expressions, which may not be representative of the facial expressions people show when they are actually experiencing an emotion.  
				Our study will ask your opinion about what emotions you perceive in spontaneous facial expressions captured from videos of people in real-life, emotion-eliciting situations.</p>
